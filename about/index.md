***** 
I stand alone in the darkness    
The winter of my life came so fast    
Memories go back to childhood    
to days I still recall    
Oh how happy I was then     
    
There was no sorrow there was no pain    
Walking through the green fields    
Sunshine in my eyes    
    
I'm still there everywhere    
I'm the dust in the wind    
I'm the star in the northern sky     
I never stayed anywhere    
I'm the wind in the trees    
Would you wait for me forever?    
    
I'm still there everywhere    
I'm the dust in the wind    
I'm the star in the northern sky    
I never stayed anywhere    
I'm the wind in the trees    
Would you wait for me forever?    
Would you wait for me forever?    
Will you wait for me forever?
