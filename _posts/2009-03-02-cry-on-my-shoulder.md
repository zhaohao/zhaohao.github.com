Deutschland sucht den superstar

If the hero never comes to you, if you need someone you're feeling blue.

If you're away from love and you're alone, if you call your friends and nobody's home.

You can run away but you can't hide, through a storm and through a lonely night.

Then I show you there's a destiny, the best things in life they're free.

But if you wanna cry...cry on my shoulder.

If you need someone who cares for you, if you're feeling sad your heart gets colder.

Yes I show you what real love can do!

If your sky is grey oh let me know, there's a place in heaven where we'll go.

If heaven is a million years away, oh just call me and I make your day.

When the nights are getting cold and blue, when the days are getting hard for you.

I will always stay here by your side. I promise you I'll never hide!

But if you wanna cry...cry on my shoulder.

If you need someone who cares for you, if you're feeling sad your heart gets colder.

Yes I show you what real love can do!

But if you wanna cry...cry on my shoulder.

If you need someone who cares for you, if you're feeling sad your heart gets colder.

Yes I show you what real love can do!

What real love can do...What real love can do...What love can do...What love can do...
