I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
Theres no one in sight
And were still making love
In My Secret Life
I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In My Secret Life
Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of My Secret Life
Looked through the paper
Makes you want to cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That its either black or white
Thank God its not that simple
In My Secret Life
