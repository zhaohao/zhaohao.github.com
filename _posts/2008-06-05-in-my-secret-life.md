LEONARD COHEN LYRICS

In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life.In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life.
I saw you this morning,you were moving so fast,can’t seem to loosen my grip,On the past.
And I miss you so much,there’s no one in sight,and we’re still making love.

In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life.
I smile when I’m angry,I cheat and I lie.
I do what I have to do,to get by.
But I know what is wrong,and I know what is right,and I’d die for the truth.

In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life.
Hold on, hold on, my brother,my sister, hold on tight.
I finally got my orders.
I’ll be marching through the morning,marching through the night.
moving cross the borders,of my Secret Life.

Looked through the paper,makes you want to cry.
Nobody cares if the people,live or die.
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it’s either black or white.
Thank God it’s not that simple
In my Secret Life.

I bite my lip.
I buy what I’m told:From the latest hit,to the wisdom of old.
But I’m always alone,and my heart is like ice,and it’s crowded and cold.

In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life,in my Secret Life,in my Secret Life.
In my Secret Life,in my Secret Life,in my Secret Life……
