i stand alone in the darkness the winter of my life come so fast

memories go back to childhood to days i still recall

oh how happy i was then there was no sorrow there was no pain

walking through the green field sunshine in my eyes

i am still there everywhere i am the dust in the wind i am the star in the
northern sky

i never stay anywhere i am the wind in the trees would you wait for me
forever
