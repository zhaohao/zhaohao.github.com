Procrastination is avoiding doing something    
Procrastination is not being able to get started    
It's reading a book    
It's descaling a kettle    
It's colour-coordinating your shelves    
It's sharpening your pencil    
Procrastination is spending thirty minutes    
looking for the right pen    
It's spending ten minutes getting the right pen to work    
Procrastination is making a cup of tea    
Procrastination is finding    
the most difficult way of doing something    
It's jumping from one idea...    
to another...    
to another    
It's checking your e-mails...    
writing your e-mails    
Procrastination is thesaurisizing words in your e-mails    
Procrastination is making a cup of tea    
Procrastination is staring at the window, it's...    
watching the neighbours    
It's watching television    
It's being unable to stop watching television    
It's smoking a cigarette    
It's doing the dishes    
Procrastination is tidying your desk    
It's creating...    
a fire-escape plan    
Procrastination is rearranging your furniture    
It's playing computer games    
It's playing imaginary computer games with your furniture    
Procrastination is pairing up your socks    
It's writing thank you letters,    
it's not writing thank you letters    
Procrastination... is daydreaming    
Procrastination is petting something    
It's watering a plant    
It's doodling    
Procrastination is trying to grow a moustache    
It's chasing a fly    
It's chopping your pencil    
It's doing eight things at once    
and not getting one done    
Procrastination is taking a nap    
Procrastination is getting drunk    
It's scratching yourself    
It's making a cup of tea    
It's cutting your finger    
It's oiling the bike    
It is picking your nose    
It's waiting for the postman    
It's trying to avoid the inevitable    
Procrastination is writing lists    
It's not being able to decide    
what way to do something    
It's overcomplicating things for yourself    
It's being afraid to finish something    
It's not knowing when to finish something    
It's not knowing how to finish something
