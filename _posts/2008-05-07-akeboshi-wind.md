cultivate your hunger before you idealize
motivate your anger to make them realize
climbing the moutain. never coming down?
break into the contents. never falling down

my knee is still shaking like i was twelve
sneaking out the class room by the back door
a man railed at me twice but i didn't care
waiting is wasting for people like me.
don't try to live so wise.
don't cry coz you're so right.
don't dry with fakes or fears.
coz you will hate yourself in the end.

you say "dreams are dreams.
i ain't gonna play the fool anymore."
you say "coz i still got my soul."
take your time baby your blood needs to slow down.
"breach your soul.""reach yourself before you gloom."
reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing.
shadows of nothing.

you still are blind if you see the winding road.
coz there is always a straight way to the point you see
don't try to live so wise.
don't cry coz you're so right.
don't dry with fakes or fears.
coz you will hate yourself in the end.
