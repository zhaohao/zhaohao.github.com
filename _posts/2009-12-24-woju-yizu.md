给”蜗居””蚁族”一代的箴言    胡敏     分类：胡敏语录之人生感言

小时候，我特别着迷于《一千零一夜》中辛伯达7次航海的故事。每次出海，他都会在历经千难万险之后，满载着财富归来。按常理说，他每次收获的财富都足够他享用一辈子，但他为什么还要一次次出征呢？我想，在辛伯达终于年迈收山的时候，如果有人问他7次历险得到的最珍贵的财宝是什么，他肯定会回答：”一颗心”。人生的莫大喜悦，难道不是拥有一颗包容大千世界的心么？难道它不值得我们历尽艰险去获得么？

“求索感悟”是我在这些年中陆续写下来的。这里的文字往往闪现于某些非常的时刻，又在之后的岁月中沉淀下来，成为我的”航海日志”，我内心的珍藏。

1) 一个人要想取得点成绩，你所从事的领域要么是别人做过的，你应想方设法比别人做得更好，要么是别人没有做过的，你必须重新开辟一个新的领域。

If you wish to achieve a certain degree of success, you must strive to excel others who are working in the field you have devoted yourself to. If nobody is working in that field, you must make an extra effort to open up new territory.

2) 在机会面前有五种人，第一种人创造机会，第二种人寻找机会，第三种人等待机会，第四种人错过机会，第五种人漠视机会。我们如果做不了第一种人，至少也要主动去寻找机会。

When it comes to opportunity, there are five types of people. One type creates opportunity. The second seeks opportunity. The third waits for opportunity to come. The fourth fumbles opportunity. The fifth ignores opportunity. If you can't be the first type ofperson, then at least try to be like the second type, and actively seek opportunity.

3) 在任何时候，我都要求自己不要作无原则的攀比。如果比的话，一个前提，学别人的优点和长项，而不是跟人比具体的财富和智慧。多数时候，我只跟自己作纵向的比较，自己的今天和昨天相比是否有所进步，而明天是否会超越今天，永远挑战自己，超越自己。

I always make sure that I do not heedlessly compare myself with something beyond my reach. If I do make such a comparison, I make sure that I study that person's advantages and strong points, and not compare my situation with that person's overall talents and wisdom. Most of the time, I simply compare my own course of development: Have I made progress today compared with yesterday, and will I do better tomorrow than today?In this way, I continually challenge myself and surpass myself.

4) 成功的人生如同登高，一步一步地拾级而上，这中间会有一个个关键的转折点。每当我们走了一段路碰壁了，这一个个转折点又把我们带上了一段段崭新的道路。有时候，转折点就存在于不经意的瞬间，而更多的时候，需要我们付出巨大的努力，人生轨迹才会出现转折。

Success in life is like climbing a height: It has to be done step by step. In the course of this there are certain crucial turning points. Every time we encounter a wall while walking along a stretch of road, we turn into a brand-new stretch of road. Sometimes, a turning point can appear out of nowhere, but most of the time in our lives turning points are only reached as the result of a great deal of hard work.

5) 只要不因为失败而从此消沉，失败并不可怕。相反，年轻时的失败和挫折是一笔宝贵的财富，有了它，我们会深刻地体会到成功之路的崎岖坎坷，真正地考验自己持之以恒的毅力，更重要的是从中汲取继续奋斗的巨大动力。忍受失败是重新振作的力量源泉。

So long as we are not discouraged by setbacks, setbacks are not to be feared. On the contrary, setbacks and failures in one's young days are valuable treasures. We can understand how full of twists and turns the road to success is, and truly test our perseverance and determination. But even more important is that you will be able to draw on a gigantic driving force enabling you to struggle continuously. Being able to bear up under defeat is the source of the renewal of vigor and strength.

6) 只有有危机意识的人才能生存、发展和壮大。

Only a person with a sense of crisis can survive, develop and grow sturdy.

7) 有许多人总是把双眼盯着远方的风景，往往却忽略了身边的精彩。

There are many people who, with their gaze fixed on the scenery in the distance, often fail to see the splendor that is right beside them.

8)在人生的任何一个角落都一样，想要别人倾听你的声音，就得凭实干取得业绩，凭实力引起注意。

In any walk of life, if you want other people to take notice of you, you can only do it by relying on solid achievements and sound abililty.

9) 永远保持18岁的心态，因为18岁有天真、淳朴、阳光的心灵，同时享有成年人的一切权利，还有对知识充满饥渴的大脑以及对生活、对未来的如火激情。

Always preserve the mentality of an 18-year-old, because at 18 you have an innocent, pristine and sunny spirit, and at the same time you enjoy all the rights of an adult. Besides, you have a brain with an overwhelming hunger and thirst for knowledge, and you have a burning enthusiasm for life and the future.

10)如果世界上仅有一种东西让你感动，那一定是真诚；如果世界上仅有一种方式能获得成功，那一定是用心。

If there is only one thing in the world that stirs your emotions, let that be sincerity.If there is only one way in the world that will enable you to achieve success, let that be diligence.
