Tagore Words~~~
Once we dreamt that we were strangers. We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.
My heart, the bird of the wilderness, has found its sky in your eyes.
It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.
You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long.
In my solitude of heart I feel the sigh of this widowed evening veiled with mist and rain.
We read the world wrong and say that it deceives us.
Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
I think of other ages that floated upon the stream of life and love
and death and are forgotten, and I feel the freedom of passing away.
Who drives me forward like fateï¼ŸThe Myself striding on my back.
Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. And yellow leaves of autumn,which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh.
